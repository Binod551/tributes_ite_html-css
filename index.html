                    <b>Prithvi Narayan Shah</b> was born prematurely on 7 January 1723 as the first 
                    child of Nara Bhupal Shah and Kaushalyavati Devi in the Gorkha Palace.[9][10]

                    Idols of PrithviNarayan Shah with his two wives Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah's 
                    education began at age five through the appropriate ceremony. At that time, 
                    the responsibility to educate him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal.
                    They were the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace as astrologers, where they were 
                    also known as Jyotishi or Jaisi[citation needed]. Even though the Gurus provided 
                    his primary education, the duty of developing his character was taken on by Queen
                    Chandra Pravawati[citation needed]. It is said that seeing the princes of neighboring
                    states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski indulge in excess pleasure, Chandra Pravawati 
                    kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from pleasurable or wrong pursuits. That is why no 
                    traces of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life.
